    abstract = {This paper proposes the development of a Raspberry Pi-based hardware platform for drinking-water quality monitoring. The selection of water quality parameters was made based on guidelines of the Central Pollution and Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for providing an interactive human machine interface to the end user for ease of operation. The Python programming language was used for GUI development, data acquisition, and data analysis. Fuzzy computing techniques were employed for decision-making to categorize the water quality in different classes like “bad”, “poor”, “satisfactory”, “good”, and “excellent”. The system has been tested for various water samples from eight different locations, and the water quality was observed as being good, satisfactory, and poor for the measured water samples. Finally, the obtained results were compared with the benchmark for authentication.},
